## Description
As the CSE team, we built our own drone to gather a dataset for testing our system. Since the EE team we are collaborating with wasn't ready to fly their drone, we took matters into our own hands. We focused on a small house built in 2017 as a senior design project for CAPPA students. You can see the 3D model of this house produced by our system in the Results Section.

*Note: The brushless ESCs and Motors occasionally arrive DoA. They tend to be reliable in the long-term, but after many drone builds with this motor & ESC combo, maybe 10% of them are faulty on arrival. For this reason, it is recommended to buy a spare pack of motors and ESCs.
