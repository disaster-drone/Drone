## Description
As the CSE team, we built our own drone to gather a dataset for testing our system. Since the EE team we are collaborating with wasn't ready to fly their drone, we took matters into our own hands. We focused on a small house built in 2017 as a senior design project for CAPPA students. You can see the 3D model of this house produced by our system in the Results Section.

## Airframe components
[S500 Quadcopter frame](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N0AX1MZ?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&ref_=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_dp_3EBSD9N5RH0X0F3YQ54M) (QTY 1)

## Power components
[5200mAh 11.1v LiPo battery](https://a.co/d/6rPRNIA) (QTY 1)

[XT60 battery connectors](https://a.co/d/amNlAyu) (QTY 1)

[Deans female to XT60 male adapter](https://a.co/d/5JDpXND) (QTY 1)

*Note: The S500 frame supports multiple wiring options through an integrated power distribution board (i.e., the power distribution is built into the structural plates of the frame). This BoM is designed to support future expansion such as camera gimbals, companion computers, and other accessories. The exact set of connectors can be modified to meet your exact implementation.

*Note: The brushless ESCs and Motors occasionally arrive DoA. They tend to be reliable in the long-term, but after many drone builds with this motor & ESC combo, maybe 10% of them are faulty on arrival. For this reason, it is recommended to buy a spare pack of motors and ESCs.
